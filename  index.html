                <li>Blackbird SR71</li>
                <li>Concorde</li>

            <p> This airplane is famous for being the biggest in the world. It can accommodate up to 850 passengers at once. </p>

            width= 320 height= 240   

            <p> The SR71 Blackbird is a military plane designed for speed and stealth. <br> Its design alllows for speeds up to Mach 3.</p>


        <h4 style="color: darkblue;text-align: center;"><strong>Concorde</strong></h4>
            <img src="Concorde.jpg" alt="Concorde"
            width= 320 height= 240   
            
            <p> I like this plane because of its unique design compared to other planes, and the legacy it carried. <br> It was capable of reaching Mach 2, flying across the Atlantic ocean in only 2 hours.</p>
